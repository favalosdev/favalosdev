### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently bootstrapping my career on AI Safety, hoping to replicate some relevant ML papers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Transformers, Mechanistic Interpretability, Scalable Oversight, Eliciting Latent Knowledge and Digital Sentience
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects in the area of AI Safety or just ML in general. Web development-wise, I'm looking for volunteers that can help me setting up the webpage for Effective Altruism Colombia
- 💬 Ask me about... anything! I'm a fast learner and a jack of all trades. My areas of "expertise", though, are Deep Learning & Web Development
- 📫 How to reach me: via e-mail (which is already listed on my GitHub profile).
- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know that if we multiply the number of arms of all the people that live on Earth, the result would be 0?
